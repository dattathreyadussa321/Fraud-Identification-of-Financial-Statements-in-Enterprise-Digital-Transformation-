# 🧠 Fraud Identification of Financial Statements in Enterprise Digital Transformation Using Deep Learning

## 📘 Overview
This project presents a **Hybrid AI-Driven Fraud Detection Framework** designed to detect and prevent **financial statement fraud** in modern enterprises undergoing **digital transformation**. The solution integrates **rule-based systems**, **pretrained AI models**, and **deep learning algorithms** to identify fraudulent activities within corporate financial data.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Financial statement fraud continues to challenge corporations, auditors, regulators, and investors. Internal actors manipulate data to misrepresent financial health—concealing inefficiencies, inflating earnings, or achieving short-term targets. Traditional methods like manual audits and rule-based systems often fail to detect emerging and complex fraud patterns.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution: Hybrid AI-Driven Fraud Detection Framework
The proposed framework employs a **three-layer architecture**:

1. **Rule-Based Detection Layer**  
   - Uses domain-specific audit rules and compliance checks.  
   - Provides transparency and interpretability.  

2. **AI Feature Extraction Layer**  
   - Utilizes **pretrained multimodal models** to analyze structured and unstructured data:  
     - Financial tables  
     - Textual disclosures (MD&A, audit notes)  
     - Scanned invoices or receipts  
   - Captures contextual fraud indicators missed by traditional models.

3. **Deep Learning Fraud Classification Layer**  
   - Trains deep learning models (LSTM, GNN) on historical fraud datasets.  
   - Continuously adapts to new patterns using labeled data and retraining.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Reduce False Positives:** Improve detection accuracy through adaptive models.  
- **Enhance Transparency:** Offer explainable, auditable insights to stakeholders.  
- **Enable Continuous Monitoring:** Integrate seamlessly with ERP/financial systems for real-time fraud detection.

## 🧩 Existing Methods and Limitations
| Method | Description | Limitation |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Rule-based Monitoring | Uses static rules to detect known anomalies | Fails with complex or new fraud schemes |
| Manual Inspection | Human audit and review | Time-consuming and unscalable |
| Pattern-based Detection | Relies on historical trends | Cannot detect unknown fraud |
| Basic ML Models | Trained on structured data | Limited generalization and adaptability |
